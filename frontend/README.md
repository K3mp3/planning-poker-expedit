# Working Agile, Scrum - Team Reflection

## General

Totally new to the concept of Scrum and agile working methods, the team liked this way to organize our work.
After reciving the assignment we aimed to have a mvp in our main branch at the end of the course. This goal was <br>
achived and we all feel that the scrum ideas helped us reach this goal.

## Story Points

Overall our estimation was correct. In a few cases we had to adjust the SP value due to things taking a bit longer <br>
than we thought, although we were not completely off. We discussed the fact that we are a new group that haven't worked together before<br>
and that it takes some time to find the group efficiency level, by that we meen how many story points we can produce during a week. <br>
<br>
We learned that a team also maybe should include meeting time estimation during a sprint planning and assign a amount of story points <br>
for that too.
<br>
Story Points is a good way to measure your own productivity and over time a tool to see your own personal development and skill<br>
improvment. Maybe someting to bring to the salary negotiation!

## Takeaways - scrum

- Good tool to organize team work.
- Gives space for everyone to express ideas (stand-ups, retros).
- Raises the level of team integrity with the Scrum Master role.
- By isolate smaller tasks, work focus is improved.

## To keep in mind - scrum

- Stand-ups, respect the time and form of this setup, there can otherwise drift over to talking about stuff that doesn't matter.
- Be serious when setting story points, the more thought put in to this process the better the team can plan their time.

## How to apply this technique in future work

- Continue to use the tools we learned, like project tool on gitHub and trello.
- When working in a new team we point out the importance of having stand-ups and retros<br>
  if not scrum, in some way similar.
- Recap team effort often/weekly, get a feeling for the work-load the team can handle.
- Work in smaller chunks and adjust, this helps to estimate time to delivery.
